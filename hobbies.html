    <h1>Isaiah's Hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Gaming
            <p>
                One of my constant hobbies since I was a toddler was 
                playing video games. The first console that I ever owned 
                was the Playstation 2. It introduced me to different 
                titles like Resident Evil, WWE Smackdown vs Raw, NBA 2K, 
                NBA Live, etc.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Movie and TV show Binging
            <p>
                I started watching movies and TV shows as a hobby 
                during my high school days. Some of my favorite movies 
                can be any of the three movies in the Cornetto trilogy, 
                but if I were to pick my favorite, I would probably pick 
                The World's End as my favorite. My favorite TV Show is 
                Breaking Bad. I also enjoyed watching The Walking Dead 
                and Game of Thrones.

        </li>
        <li>Listening to Music
            <p>
                Music connects us, humans, and that is why I enjoy 
                listening to different kind of music whether it be a 
                summer pop song or an r&b soul music.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Web Development
            <p>
                I love learning. One of the things that I am interested 
                in learning is Web Development. Just the idea of 
                creating awesome websites excites me. I know it takes a 
                lot of work to be really good at it but that is what 
                drives me to keep learning the course.
